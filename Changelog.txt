v4.1.1 (april 2023)
- Added two parameters to the config file: USE_ACCENT and LED_Index. 
  It is now possible to configure the PMDM to work without accents. This makes it possible to leave out one TLC5940 (U6), 
  the opamp buffers (U1...U4) and all the associated components. (see build guide for more information).




v4.1 (feb 2023) 
- The name of Poor Man's 909 (PM-909) is changed to Poor Man's Drum Machine (PMDM). 
- The PM-909 and PM-808 schematics are merged into a single PMDM schematic. 
- The schematic is tidied up and all 16 voices are drawn. 
- MIDI in circuit slightly modified (pull up resistor increased to 1,2K, added decoupling capacitor, 10K resistor to ground removed).
- The CV opamp buffers now give a CV range of 0-15 Volt. If only 0-5 Volt CV range is needed,
  two resistors should be omitted per opamp buffer (see schematic for more information).
